# Covid19-Data-analysis-python
Python project for data analysis on Covid19 cases across the world
For my project, I looked at different data sources and used Python tools to study how COVID-19 is affecting the world. I checked out the data closely, made graphs to see how the virus is spreading, and tried to guess which countries might have the most cases. I based my guesses on things like deaths, active cases, new cases and recovered cases.
